"""Snapshot service: Composes info and quote into a single response.

If either fetch_info or fetch_quote fails, the entire request returns 502,
keeping consistent error semantics with individual endpoints.

Caching strategy:
- Info (company metadata) is cached with a 5-minute TTL; it's relatively stable.
- Quote (latest price) is always fetched fresh to ensure currency.
